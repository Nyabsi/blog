# About Me

Hello : )

I am a self-taught developer, perhaps even a *bit* of an technology geek.

I have appreciation for low-level languages like C, C++ and Zig which makes it easier for computers to do what they're not supposed to do.

Regular languages: C++, Kotlin, Python

Currently working on Virtual Reality and 3D content (Spatial) creation related projects.

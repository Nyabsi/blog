# What it is this?

You may ask that yourself, if you happened to stumble upon this humble site of mine.

It's a personal blog of mine, where I share things that I find interesting, intriguing or otherwise just complicated, I feel like I should explain in plain English instead of the usual cipher I tend to speak...

Well, in all honesty, I will probably just dump my own rational thoughts and opinions here about things. I am not expecting people to read, find or share this But. If you happen to find this site somehow-

feel free to read my ramblings, that I often write late at night : )

# About Me

I am self-taught developer who has learned programming for years at this point and touched everything from web development to making games for Virtual Reality headsets.

I primarily enjoy programming in languages that give more freedom and are less restrictive such as C/C++ but I also do enjoy using plenty of other languages like Python, C# and Kotlin to name few.

I would not say I am "good" by any chance, but I do know a thing or two.
